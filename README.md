# APPLE INSPIRED BUY PAGE

In this project, the buy iphone page from Apple was taken as an inspiration to create a well designed UI. The three main sections are implemented:

1. Image with draggable icon on the left side
2. Input Box (for x and y coordinates) that utilizes data-binding using props to dynamically update when the icon is dragged.
   **Note**: Input and drag is limited to 300x150 using normalisation to align with dimensions of the poster
3. Material Selection section which has selected and non-selected states. Only one material can be selected at a time and at least one has to be selected. Default is first one.
